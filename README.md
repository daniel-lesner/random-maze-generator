App that generates a random maze, along with a solution for exit, if any, made using plain JavaScript and PixiJS.

Bundled with WebPack, used OOP, self-made graphics and made my own implementation of the A* Search Algorithm.

Commands to bundle:
- npm install build  (installs node modules)
- npm run build

Notes for bundling:
 - always have index.js in src folder
 - remove style.css & index.js from index.html (webpack connects them automatically)
 - PIXI has to be declared globally
